    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Indian Institute of Information Technology Ranchi is an autonomous institute setup by the MHRD, Government of India, and Government of Jharkhand along with the industry partners Tata Motors, TCS and CCL on a Public Private Partnership. MHRD, Government of India has taken up the initiative to setup 20 new Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) on a Public Private Partnership Model. A major objective in establishing IIITs is to set up a model of education which can produce best-in-class human resources in IT and harnessing the multi-dimensional facets of information technology in various domains.

The IIIT Ranchi is expected to meet operating expenses from tuition fees, grants, sponsorships and donations. Additionally, the Government of Jharkhand has lent support to the institute by granting land for setting up the Campus at Ranchi, Jharkhand.

The institute is managed by professionals from the area of academics and research, under the guidance of a Board of Governors of the Institute that has representatives of participating Industry partners, eminent academicians & researchers and representatives from Government.
